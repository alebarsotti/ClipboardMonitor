TODOs:
    - Tests.
    - Dependency injection.
    - Search.
    - Favorite entries.
    - Disable monitor for certain processes.
    - Global hotkey for showing the main window.
    - Insert entry text by double-clicking its row.
    - Edit entry.
    - Avoid duplicate entries.
    - Implement ObservableCollection with custom methods (add a list of objects, replace entire collection, etc).
    - Number the entries. Configure some shortcut to copy entry nยบ "x".
    - Add new entries at the top of the scrolling list.
    - Show a "star" button in each entry to save it as "favorite" (another scrolling list).
    - Add an option to clear the entire history. The Favorites list shouldn't be cleared when this button is pressed.
        - (probably unnecessary) Auto-delete old entries.
